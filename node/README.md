For our mini JavaScript client that works with node.js too, please see [this repository](https://github.com/import-io/client-js-mini).

--
The above client libraries have now been deprecated in favour of our improved API docs (http://api.docs.import.io/).  

The client libraries, of course, will remain in this space for people that are already using them. But, we will no longer be   building them out.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact support@import.io
